# Setup

Additional steps to be completed once your project has been created.

- Open the project and delete the www folder (Right-click the www folder in the Select "Remove References Only")

Your project is now ready to be compiled.

# Troubleshooting

==
I get this error shortly after login:
'ERROR: Start Page at \'www/index.html\' was not found.'  (visible in the web view)

You need to remove and re-add the www folder to your project.  See the instructions above.
