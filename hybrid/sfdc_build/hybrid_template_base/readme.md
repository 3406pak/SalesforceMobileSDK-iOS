# Setup

Additional steps to be completed once your project has been created.

- Open the project and remove the www folder (Right-click the www folder in the Project Navigator, select Delete from the popup menu, and click "Remove References Only")
- Re-add the www folder. Right-click the project name folder in the Project Navigator, Add Files, and select the www folder in the file selection dialog. Be sure that "Create folder references for any added folders" is selected

Your project is now ready to be compiled.

# Troubleshooting

I get this error shortly after login:
'ERROR: Start Page at \'www/index.html\' was not found.'  (visible in the web view)

You need to remove and re-add the www folder to your project.  See the instructions above.
